## Time commitment

Typically, our volunteers contribute ~ 1 to 2 hours per week.

##  Priorities

For volunteers, we expect contributor priorities should be:
1. Family comes first, then
2. Work comes next, then
3. Volunteering.

It is okay (and expected) to pause volunteering when higher priorities come up. Just let your coworkers know.
