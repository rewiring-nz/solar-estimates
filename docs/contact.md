# Contributing

**Last updated:** Jan 2026

We are interested to hear from like-minded, tech savvy people tackling similar problems who are interested in collaborating with us.

You can see our last task status and priorities in our [Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/rewiring-nz/projects/3).

## Contact

We communicate and share content via:

* Our public [solarmap-nz-tech](https://groups.google.com/g/solarmap-nz-tech) email list.
* An internal slack chat channel.
* A weekly meeting.
* Our [solar-estimates](https://github.com/rewiring-nz/solar-estimates) github repository.

## Time commitment

Typically, our volunteers contribute ~ 1 to 2 hours per week.

##  Priorities

For volunteers, we expect contributor priorities should be:
1. Family comes first, then
2. Work comes next, then
3. Volunteering.

It is okay (and expected) to pause volunteering when higher priorities come up. Just let your coworkers know.
