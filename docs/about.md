# About
This project will provide accurate and validated estimates of rooftop solar potential for almost every building in New Zealand, for use in tools such as interactive maps.

## Features

* **Comprehensive**: Aims to cover every building in New Zealand, where data is available.  
* **Sophisticated modelling**: Will incorporate roof angles, shade profiles, weather patterns, economics.  
* **Useful layers**: Potential area and generation estimates can be aggregated by building type, region/local council area, and nationwide.  
* **Free**: The data, methodology, software, and any web front-end are shared for free under open licenses.

## Project goals

* Empower policymakers, planners, councils, community champions, businesses and households to make evidence based decisions which accelerate the roll out of rooftop solar.  
* Provide personalised, detailed, and trustworthy evidence of the rooftop solar potential for every rooftop in New Zealand.  
* Demonstrate that rooftop solar provides the cheapest delivered energy in New Zealand, even with New Zealand’s mountains, low winter sun angles, and shaded valleys.
