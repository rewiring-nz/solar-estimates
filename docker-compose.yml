# Configures a Docker Compose setup for the solar pipeline project.
# Sets up a containerized application with the necessary dependencies,
# mounts local directories for seamless development, and persists the
# GRASS database using a named volume.

# Usage:
# 1. Ensure Docker (20.10+) and Docker Compose (v2.0+) are installed on your system.
# 2. Navigate to the directory containing this file.
# 3. Run `docker compose up pipeline` to build and start the container.
# 4. Use `docker compose down` to stop and remove the container.
# 5. Run `docker compose up docs` to start the doc server at http://0.0.0.0:8000/ .
# 6. Type ^C to stop.

# Define the services (containers) you want to run

  # Run this with: `docker compose up pipeline`

    # Mount local directories for seamless development and persistence
    volumes:
      # Mount the entire project root. Changes to your code are instantly reflected.
      # Local root (where docker-compose.yml is) -> Container's /app
      - .:/app
      
      # Persist the GRASS database (grassdata) using a Docker named volume.
      # GRASS data is now expected in /app/src/grassdata
      - grass_db:/app/src/grassdata
    # We explicitly define the command here so 'up' runs it immediately.
    # Paths are relative to the WORKDIR /app/src defined in the Dockerfile.
