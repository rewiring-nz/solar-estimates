# Configures a Docker Compose setup for the solar pipeline project.
# Sets up a containerized application with the necessary dependencies,
# mounts local directories for seamless development, and persists the
# GRASS database using a named volume.

# Usage:
# 1. Ensure Docker (20.10+) and Docker Compose (v2.0+) are installed on your system.
# 2. Navigate to the directory containing this file.
# 3. Run `docker compose up` to build and start the container.
# 4. Use `docker-compose down` to stop and remove the container.

# Define the services (containers) you want to run
services:
  solar_pipeline:
    # Build context is the current directory, using the Dockerfile
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      platforms:
        - linux/amd64
    
    platform: linux/amd64
    
    container_name: nz_solar_pipeline_dev
    
    # Mount local directories for seamless development and persistence
    volumes:
      # Mount the entire project root. Changes to your code are instantly reflected.
      # Local root (where docker-compose.yml is) -> Container's /app
      - .:/app
      
      # Persist the GRASS database (grassdata) using a Docker named volume.
      # GRASS data is now expected in /app/src/grassdata
      - grass_db:/app/src/grassdata
      
    # The command to run your pipeline.py for testing
    # Paths are now relative to the container's WORKDIR: /app/src
